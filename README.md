# 🏦 AI-Driven Corporate Cash Flow Stress Testing Platform

## 📌 Overview

Modern multinational enterprises operate in highly volatile environments impacted by inflation, FX fluctuations, interest rate shocks, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Traditional Excel-based financial models lack probabilistic forecasting, automated risk quantification, and scalable executive reporting.

This project is a **production-grade enterprise financial analytics platform** built with Streamlit that transforms raw financial data into:

- 📊 Predictive cash flow forecasts  
- 📉 Probabilistic risk modeling (VaR / CVaR)  
- 🧪 Monte Carlo stress testing (10K–50K simulations)  
- 🤖 AI-generated executive summaries (GPT-4 / Gemini)  
- 📈 Strategic decision-support dashboards  

It combines financial domain expertise with advanced data science, machine learning, and Generative AI in a modular, scalable architecture.
